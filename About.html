<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3>Creator, Guides, and other</h3>

<hr>

<p>This is a web page about us, I'm J, also the creator of this website. You see, I'm suppose to have my real name written on here, but my feeling tells me that it's not a smart thing to do. So just remember me as J, oh and a fun fact that you might already know: J is for Joker in playing cards. Just like S is for spade, and K is for King. Well, the reason we use playing cards is that a lot of Phantom Thieves likes to use it. There's many Phantom thieves using "Joker" as their code name.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are some fun fact about me, J. My favorite Phantom Thief is Kid, second is Arsene Lupin, third...I think it's Joker (persona 5). I like cold colors more than warm colors. I've been thinking for a long time on picking the topic for this website, between Detective and Phantom Thief, I choose Phantom Thief, because I know more about Phantom Thieves than Detectives. Oh, and my favorite Detective is Sherlock Holmes(original), second is Edogawa Conan(Detective Conan/Case Closed), third is Sherlock Holmes(SHERLOCK).</p>
