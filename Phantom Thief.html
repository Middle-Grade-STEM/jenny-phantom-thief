<p>Hi, it's J, right now I will tell you some basic things of Phantom Thieves, just so you are prepared. <br> Phantom Thieves, also called Gentleman Thief, or Lady Thief(depends on identity). Called by different names, but do the same things. <br> Phantom Thieves are unlike normal thieves, normal thieves sneaks around in the dark, wait for a chance, steal their target, and just runs away trying to run away without being seen. But Phantom Thieves want people to see them, want people to know that they exist. <br>You won't know when will a normal thief comes and steal your thing, but you will know when will a phantom thief came, because a lot of phantom thieves sends out notice letter before they steal. Well, some Phantom Thieves like to write the notice in the form of riddles, and reason...I think it's their own ways of "playing" with the detectives and polices chasing after them. <br>Phantom Thieves also likes to dress in fancy, and easy-to-see costumes, not all of them, but a lot of them likes to do that, probably because they wants to get separated from normal thieves. <br>Some of them likes to surprise people, and made their whole stealing process looks like a performance. Including appearing in white smoke, magic tricks, and all sorts of stuff, but don't think all of the Phantom Thieves are like this, They usually just do performances when they appears, and leaves.<br> A lot of Phantom thieves steal not because they enjoy the process of stealing, but for various reasons that mostly are for helping people. <br> Well, just remember, Phantom Thieves are not normal thieves, they steal but don't harm, a whole lot of them helps people when they are in danger.</p>

<p><small>Just a notice by J: Your Guide that introduce you to Arsene Lupin is a pretty...fun, person, so...don't show an "I think there's something wrong with you" face at him, really, please don't, or else he will probably start another chaos around this place.</small></p>
